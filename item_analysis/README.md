Item analysis of the stimuli questions presented to the participants during the CHT fMRI task

Since the presentation script was transition from Psychtoolbox in Matlab to Psychopy in Python, there is code here to analyze both data files.

* trial_data.m & trial_data.R -- matlab and R functions to:
  1. Read in the data
  2. Pull the relevant data for item analysis
  3. Organize

 * item_analysis.m & item_analysis.R -- matlab and R code for the actual analysis and organization of the data files

 * Rmat_integrated_analysis.R -- code to bring together and analyze the data from matlab and R data
